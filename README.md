# OOP Programming Laboratory 2

## Lab Overview
This lab is a continuation of OOP Programming Lab 1.  
In the first lab, we worked with data processing in a **procedural programming style** — using normal functions like `filter()` and `aggregate()` to process a CSV file of cities and temperatures.

In this lab, we learned how to **convert procedural code into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** style.  
We used **classes** like `DataLoader` and `Table` to make the code more organized, reusable, and easier to read.  

The main goal was to:
- Learn how to define and use classes.
- Understand how to move functions into methods.
- Practice lambda functions for filtering and aggregation.
